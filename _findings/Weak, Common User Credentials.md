| Description (Incl. Root<br>Cause) | It was found that a user is using a weak, common password for authentication to the TeamCity dashboard. Weak credentials are those with low password-complexity and can be easily guessed(via "password-cracking"). Common credentials tend to be weak in-nature, but include credentials found in widely available public "wordlists" or "dictionaries", these are passwords from previously breached systems that are compiled together in a list.                                    |
| Security Impact                   | An attacker who can gain un-authorized access to a users hash, such as taking advantage of another vulnerability that allows them to backup or 'dump' a services database, can potentially uncover the users clear-text password via offline password cracking. This can lead to access to the service associated with the hash, potentially leaking sensitive information, allowing modification of the service, or used as a "foothold" to move deeper within the system and network. |

| Remediation                       | Set a internal password policy that requires strong passwords company-wide. These should impose a minimum character-limit, ideally 16+ with numerical and special character requirements.<br><br>Consider using a organization-wide password manager, protected with a strong master password, that generates random passwords for each user with accordance to the company password policy.                                                                                            |
