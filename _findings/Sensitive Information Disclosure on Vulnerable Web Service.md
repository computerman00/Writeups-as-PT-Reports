| Description (Incl. Root<br>Cause) | There exists a open API endpoint that allows an unauthenticated user to retrieve the Full Name, Username, and email for all users registered on the service. Further, a request can be made to another open API endpoint that allows an unauthenticated user to retrieve the name, username, and clear-text password for the database user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Security Impact                   | An attacker could potentially leverage this to leak information on all registered users, this includes their full name, username, and email. This information can then be used by an attacker to start phishing campaigns against users, or even create a dictionary/list that can be used to spray passwords against the valid users. Further, an attacker leveraging this vulnerability can retrieve the username and plain-text password for the mysql database user. This can be used to spray the password for the user across multiple services, potentially allowing unauthorized access to any services where the password is re-used. If the database is exposed externally, this can give access to the database, which may grant the ability to obtain user password hashes or even inserting a new administrator account into the database. |

| Remediation                       | Update the affected Joomla instance to a version greater than 4.2.7. Ensure the service is periodically monitored to ensure it is up-to-date, especially in the case of publically disclosed vulnerabilities for the in-use version.<br><br>Further, to decrease the impact of a leaked password, ensure passwords are never re-used across multiple services and the mysql database for the service is not exposed externally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
