| Description (Incl. Root<br>Cause) | The tester discovered a SSH private key stored in TeamCity backups within a projects `plugin` directory. SSH private keys are sensitive and pose significant security risks, as they allow for shell-level access to the host machine as the user the key belongs to.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Security Impact                   | An attacker who can potentially gain access to the TeamCity backup files and uncover the SSH private key within will have full SSH access to the underlying machine as the user associated to the key. This can lead to un-authorized access to the machine, allowing the attacker to extract sensitive information, modify files or services accessible to the user, and use the machine as a pivot point to move laterally within the network. |
