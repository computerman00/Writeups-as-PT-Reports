| Description (Incl. Root<br>Cause) | A user within the Active Directory domain was discovered to be using weak credentials. Weak or common credentials are those that can easily be 'guessed', either in the form of offline password cracking or via password 'spraying'. An AD domain-joined user with weak credentials is especially dangerous, as it typically grants access to multiple systems and services within the domain with a single sign on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Security Impact                   | An attacker with access to AD domain-joined user accounts can potentially gain un-authorized access to machines, read sensitive files from network shares, or control services in which the user holds high privileges. In the event that an AD domain user is compromised, the attacker can spray their credentials across all services on the domain(and internal network). This can lead to unauthorized access to various systems or documents, including the potential to leverage the account to further the attackers access into a service, domain, or network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Remediation                       | It is recommended to change the password to a long(16+ character), strong password with requirements set for numerical and special characters, ideally facilitated through a password manager than can generate/store strong random passwords with a substantially secure master password.<br><br>To further limit the impact of a weak compromised password, it is recommended to implement MFA(Multi-Factor-Authentication) across the domain and any related services. This ensures that even if a credential was fully compromised, an attacker cannot log-into the account without an additional factor of authentication(such as temporary codes or biometrics).<br><br>In addition, consider training employees on safe password hygiene and habits, this includes things like not sharing passwords, using strong passwords, and never re-using passwords across different services or accounts unless facilitated through a SSO(Single Sign On) service with strong credential and additional factor authentication. |
