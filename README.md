# Writeups-as-PT-Reports

This is working project to create and re-write some of my CTF and RETIRED HTB Box write-ups in a Penetration Test Report style. Each report is represented in the format of a mini-PT report, aiming to be 20-50 pages in length and including sections like Executive Summaries, Assessment Summaries, Attack-Chain walkthroughs, Remediation Summaries, Individual Findings, and more. This project also includes a [FindingsDB](https://computerman00.github.io/Writeups-as-PT-Reports/findings.html) with the purpose of building out a database for all findings encountered.

The idea is to use lengthy (RETIRED) HTB Labs or CTF challenges and go through them as if they were a penetration test. Instead of just going for flags and making a standard write-up, we treat it like a real engagement and create a full fledged report. 

The motivation for this project is to practice writing penetration test reports that a real-world client would be satisfied with, while also striving to serve as an example that can help others interested in writing their own reports.
