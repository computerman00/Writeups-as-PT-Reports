<h3>This is working project to create and re-write some of my CTF and RETIRED HTB Box write-ups in a Penetration Test Report style. Each report is reprented in the format of a mini-PT report, aiming to be 20-50 pages in length and including sections like Executive Summaries, Assessment Summaries, Attack-Chain walkthroughs, Remediation Summaries, and more.<br><br>This project also includes a <a href="findings.html">FindingsDB</A> with the purpose of building out a database for all findings encountered. This project ultimately serves as penetration test report writing practice while also hoping to help others.</h3>
